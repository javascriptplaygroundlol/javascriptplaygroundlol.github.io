# JavaScript Playground 1.0
[JavaScript Playground](https://javascriptplaygroundlol.github.io/) is a website for making Javascript code freely!

You can learn, warm up, or even actually do your code in here!

# The others:
There are also [HTML](https://javascriptplaygroundlol.github.io/htmlpg.html), [CSS](https://javascriptplaygroundlol.github.io/csspg.html), and [TypeScript](https://javascriptplaygroundlol.github.io/typescriptpg.html) versions of JS Playground. So if you want to also do HTML, CSS, or TypeScript, use the others.
